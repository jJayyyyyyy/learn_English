Sugar - Maroon 5

I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down

I need your loving, loving I need it now

When I'm without you

I'm something weak

You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

<br/><br/>

I don't wanna be needing your love

I just wanna be deep in your love

And it's killing me when you're away

Ooh baby

'Cause I really don't care where you are

I just wanna be there where you are

And I gotta get one little taste

<br/><br/>

('your) Sugar

Yes please

Won't you come and put it down on me

I'm right here cause I need

Little love and little sympathy

Yeah you show me good loving

Make it alright

Need a little a sweetness in my life

('your) sugar

Yes please

Won't you come and put it down on me

<br/><br/>

My broken pieces

You pick them up

Don't leave me hanging hanging

Come get me some

When I'm without ya

('ah) So insecure

You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

<br/><br/>

I don't wanna be needing your love

I just wanna be deep in your love

And it's killing me when you're away

Ooh baby

'Cause I really don't care where you are

I just wanna be there where you are

And I gotta get one little taste

<br/><br/>

('your) Sugar

Yes please

Won't you come and put it down on me

I'm right here cause I need

Little love and little sympathy

Yeah you show me good loving

Make it alright

Need a little a sweetness in my life

('your) Sugar

Yes please

Won't you come and put it down on me

<br/><br/>

Yeah

I want that red velvet

I want that sugar sweet

Don't let nobody touch it

Unless that somebody is me

I gotta be a man

There ain't no other way

'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern california bay

<br/><br/>

I don't wanna play no games

You don't gotta be afraid

Don't give all that shy shit

No make up on

<br/><br/>

That's my

Sugar

Won't you come and put it down on me
